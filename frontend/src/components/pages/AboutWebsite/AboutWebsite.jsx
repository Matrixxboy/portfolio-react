                    This portfolio was originally developed using <span className="font-semibold text-color-primary">Laravel</span>. Although I enjoyed working with it, deployment proved difficult due to my limited experience with Laravel pipelines. After several attempts, I transitioned the project to <span className="font-semibold text-color-primary">React with Vite</span> ‚Äî a stack I'm more confident in and have used successfully for previous projects.
                </p>

                <p className="text-base sm:text-lg  animate-slide-up delay-150">
                    The result is a lightweight, fast, and fully responsive website. Thanks to my experience deploying React-based academic and personal projects, the migration was smooth and fulfilling.
                </p>

                <p className="text-base sm:text-lg  animate-slide-up delay-300">
                    I personally designed the entire <span className="text-color-primary font-medium">UI/UX</span> of this website, reflecting my creative vision and personal style. I also received helpful feedback from friends and classmates to refine the user experience and design consistency.
                </p>

                    This portfolio is more than just a website ‚Äî it's a dynamic space for growth, creativity, and exploration as I evolve in the tech world.
